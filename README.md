# Kage Bunshin no Jutsu with 3D touch!
In this project, I developed a game with 3D touch controls.

    Hold finger on the screen to control Naruto and press in to let him use Kage Bunshin no Jutsu to split.
    Try avoid the fire traps and keep forwarding, this is not an easy game, but you will enjoy it.
    
Note:

    The app will only works on devices support 3D touch.
